    "### Competition Overview\n",
    "DataHack is a datathon hosted by Club Sientifique de l'Esi (CSE) community in The Higher National School of Computer Science (ESI ex INI) Algiers for 2023/2024 season.\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "In this Challenge, you are tasked with developing machine learning models to identify spam and non-spam (genuine) reviews from Chicago hotels and restaurants. The dataset consists of reviews and metadata, and the goal is to create models that accurately classify reviews as either spam (Y) or non-spam (N).  \n",

    "#### **Note** :\n",
    "in this notebook i've kept only the reviews columns in order to use BERT , later on in theis competition i've tried encoding the reviews column with Word2Vec and used XGBoost which gave me way better results (because i exploited the other columns)  "

    "This code defines a custom PyTorch Dataset class named `CustomDataset` for processing textual data in a datathon competition.
